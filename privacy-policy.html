            <p>This privacy policy applies to the AptNest app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices
                that was created by LEXIOT (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is
                intended for use "AS IS".</p>
            <br>

            <strong>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</strong>
            <p>The Application does not obtain any information when you download and use it. Registration is not
                required to use the Application.</p>
            <br>

            <strong>Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?</strong>
            <p>This Application does not collect precise information about the location of your mobile device.</p>
            <br>

            <strong>Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?</strong>
            <p>Since the Application does not collect any information, no data is shared with third parties.</p>
            <br>

            <strong>Third Party Access</strong>
            <p>Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service Provider in improving the Application and their service. The Service Provider may share your information with third parties in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.</p>
            <br>
            <div>
                <p>Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Privacy Policy about handling data. Below are the links to the Privacy Policy of the third-party service providers used by the Application:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        -<a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Services</a>
                    </li>

                </ul>
            </div>
            <br>

            <p>You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling it. You may use the
                standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile
                application marketplace or network.</p><br>

            <strong>Children</strong>
            <p>The Application is not used to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally
                identifiable information from children. The Service Provider
                encourages all children to never submit any personally
                identifiable information through the Application and/or Services.
                The Service Provider encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor
                their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing
                their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or
                Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child
                has provided personally identifiable information to the Service Provider through the Application and/or
                Services,
                please contact the Service Provider (info@aptnest.com) so that they will be able to take the necessary
                actions.
                You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing
                of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent
                or guardian to do so on your behalf).</p><br>

            <strong>Security</strong>
            <p>The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. However,
                since the Application does not collect any information, there is no risk of your data being accessed by

                advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of
                all changes.</p><br>
